      p Glitch's code editor allows live, real-time simultaneous editing, like Google Docs. So you and your new developer BFF can simultaneously edit code and fix bugs as they happen.
      p We're even building tools to let you see the moment a developer encounters an error for the first time while trying out your API. You can learn what needs to improve in your platform, and catch them before they give up or get frustrated.

      h2 Glitch helps you reach an inclusive developer audience

      p If you've been struggling to broaden the reach of your developer evangelism, Glitch can help. We've built a friendly, welcoming community with absolutely zero tolerance for harassment or abuse. Our outreach efforts regularly connect with underrepresented developers that other communities don't serve.
      p When you bring your platform to Glitch, you get outside the bubble of the developers you already know.
